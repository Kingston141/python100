## 🧠 Bonus Track – English Communication Growth

Alongside Python, I'm improving my vocabulary by learning **5 unique and powerful English words daily** to strengthen my **communication and articulation** skills.

Example:
- **Astute** – having sharp judgment or intelligence
- **Diligent** – showing consistent and careful effort
- **Articulate** – able to express clearly and effectively
- **Concise** – giving info in few, clear words
- **Versatile** – adaptable to many different uses
